This is a part of the practice of  finding simplified line and form.

I found a book. 

Hokusai, the Ukiyoe master left a book for practiting painting. The tiltle is called "*a little known how-to book*" or "*quick lesson in simplified drawings*".

You can see the seceret of his drawing and composition. You might know all his composition were not created by accident or the nature of the artist's sense, intended to make. He used geometric shapes to break objects, figures, animals and landscapes down to simple line. Most efficient and stylish. 

I understand the reason why I thought Hokusai's works are somtime cold like a visual is made by computer. The composition of his works are not just appeared by artistic esthetics more like he culculated the them perfectly by using a ruler and a compas like mathmatics. 

There is another famous painter as same as Hokusai. *Hiroshige Utagawa*. He is famous for the series of "*the fifty-three stations of the Tokaido*"

He also wrote a book of how-to draw called "*ukiyoe gahu*".

His drawing is what he can observe the nature as itsself  comare to Hokusai who tried to capture the line as efficient as possible.  

Yuichi Yokoyama 

He evolve manga form into fine art. He found himself doen't fit the fine art world which is pretty strange because his art works are definitely great in comtemporary art paintings for me.. 
His line are really sharp as like a knife. You can feel the speed from the line and composition. His choice of colour is pastel and colourful represents the world is made from the flatness. 

So, is the sharp solid line only reprent simplified form?
When you see vague imagae, the figure becomes more simple. Because you can't catch much detail. So tyou can only take their atmosphere. It can be also the simplified. Who is the most blur image artist? 



Textile design is interesting to see. like marimekko. The design of the flower is so simple but thats why so powerful. you can recognize the flower as marimekko immediately. 

Disney, character has a power to influence on more large number of people with range of tempretarue. If the charactor are murdering to others, you may be able to see the scene. but if there are real people are killing others. do you think can you look at them? 

In naive art, outsider art. 

In ceramics.
There more image in ceramics because of the limitation of the materials. But the blank is more cheereful and light weight. 

Painting has been in dominated in elite. The existance is only for religion or people who are really elite. 

Textiles, ceramics are everyday uses. Ukiyoe had been developed among normal citizen. Manga and anime are as well. They are a result of people in the society's desire.  

In France, manga has a position as an art form.   


There should not have hirachy in painting. 
so light taste have ability to tell more range of things because it looks less serious.

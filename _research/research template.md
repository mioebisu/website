Everyday half-remembered memories translated into a visual image using simple gesture and reacting to the further properties of the paint, simple.

I have been aiming for light painting, seeking what gives a painting a light feeling, even with complex scenes or subjects.For me, lightness is a floating/unstable image, drawn from memory, not directly from reality. The atmosphere at the time you remember something rather than observing a photo/image, trying to draw a vague memory.How the scene looked at that time for me as a way to express how a moment was.

Painting is my core form of expression, I bring into my practice ideas of gesture and movement, space is important, the space around a painting and within, Viewer experience and translating my memory to them.

It would be more like I just want to experience, reexperience of certain moment by stroking. From those reason, the result of the scene is not always clear to the audience. I am enjoying to trace the line of my mental landscape in the dreamed-like mood.

I keep wandering around the my private experience. The my  responsivness from the world, landscape that I have the desire of being part of them or a close relationship. Beautiful mountain, how can I join your world. I can't be a wild animal, I can't be a monk, I can't be dead. 

I was thinking about is really this society only one for human? Is this the only one cosmos the human(myself) can be in? 

Painting is touching other existance in the earth. You can see the other nature by painting. 


Reexperience of certain private moment by stroking.


A past I want to replay again again again is related to my childhood time when is the long school holiday.Separated from school,friends,Tokyo.
 I often use the subject from the time or landscape triggers me to perceive and overlay those  past. it maked me want to paint for touching the scene.

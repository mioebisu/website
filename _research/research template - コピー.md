Everyday half-remembered memories translated into a visual image using simple gesture and reacting to the further properties of the paint, simple. 

I have been aiming for light painting, seeking what gives a painting a light feeling, even with complex scenes or subjects.For me, lightness is a floating/unstable image, drawn from memory, not directly from reality. The atmosphere at the time you remember something rather than observing a photo/image, trying to draw a vague memory. How the scene looked at that time for me as a way to express how a moment was.

Painting is my core form of expression, I bring into my practice ideas of gesture and movement, space is important, the space around a painting and within, Viewer experience and translating my memory to them.

I use image randomly. It is somtime from images of advertise. It is sometime from my experience. It is sometiem from other artist's art works ( Can I call it inspiration? ) I am from Tokyo the town where is one of the most dense consumercialism culture in the world as far I know. Anything will be cooked as cute, lovely image. Serious motment, social event, you can change them into "kawaii" (somehow). There is no hirachy in image. Figure, people, animal, plants, building are the same tempreture. 

I am experimenting to collaborate with sound in music. To collage a room with sound and visual. The sound is found sound, and the visual intereact to the sound and make the space organic and natural. I do live performance with them to use found random object and use the elements of these to interact the improvised sound while musician are playing. This is helpful to open my sense towards painitng. 

The project I am thinking of is that ceramics. I found the colour in the ceramics is the ideal and real quality for me. It would start with tiles, then I want to carry it on next stage.

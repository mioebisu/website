To reexperience private mental view by the outline of insubstantial.  


To back to my childhood, I was ordinary child in Tokyo.  The time I was waiting for was long school holiday. My father was separated from our family because of his job mining engineer. At the end of the school term, soon as I came back from the school, me and my mother and my elder sister immediately head to his place. He moved several places, most of the places were deep mountain site which is opposite to Tokyo. I loved this moment to leave Tokyo to take shinkansen, sometime night bus, sometime air plane. I  was being able to escape from the everyday life with school, friends, polluted air and ugly concrete jungle to beautiful nature with romantic isolation from the society. 

Lanscape in painter 

This overwhelmed emotional feeling in landscape comes with the artists private responce to this has been interests by artists. Peter Doig's painting are landscape from his experiences from living in several countries such as Canada, England, Scotland and Trinidad. Japanese painter Makiko Kudo she uses her childhood memory with multiple perspective in one paining, her delicated brush stroke express a trace of touching her past time. 

To see the view is challenging. The view you are seeing is not always same as what other peope are seeing. The south african artist Moshekwa Langa's art works are hard to classified. “People can’t reconcile my idiosyncratic views with their own desire to classify me”'(https://www.e-flux.com/announcements/35955/moshekwa-langa-s-marhumbini-in-another-time/e-flux) He is holding his childhood time in south africa and current life in Europe. His drawings have a ambivuant figure unrecognizable nationalities or races. Those figure or lines are part of the consists of collective in the painting. The activities of drawing and painting is a methof of understanding yourself. 

Landscape will be different in the context, how you have a deal with. If you are a fan of Harry Potter, the kings cross station is more important place for them. The house famous people used live has more valued with the blue badge. The crossing on Abbey road became the iconic of beatles. Landscape is moving, changing according to people. Pokemon-go can change the normal road and city into another virtual world to catch the wild monster. The originaly post office turn to be a pocket shop which you can get items. In train, most of people are watchin smartphone. We are surrounded by images not be related to the nature. The scene we are seeing has lost consequences. Youtube, when you play onesong, the next song will be played automatically selected by computer. To be flood with those shed informations. How can we stay and remember the  landscape without any unexplained things included.

Yuichi Yokoyama is a manga writer and painter. He founds himself interested in time. In his manga, the time is the same speed as the reader, painting, but this is time-based as well. His subjects are Outdoor, Iceland, Engeniering. Traveling or leisure. Those world in his manga suggests us to understand the world exist like this in surrealism way. No narratives, just consequence of the activities. The colour is vivid neon, or pastel. Human's body colour is pink, green, blue. I don't see this is unreal or illustration. The combination of image within the smartphone world, this is not the huge difference from the real world. Instagram has lots of effects, so people know you can change the light setting, colour, shadow easily until you feel right in the image or yourself. 

To capture this world, understanding this world is complex and flood of image are collecting in our brain in uncouncious level. For those reason, we might lose some memories while gaining. Camera can take rialistic scene, so what can painting do. They might work as a spirit photography for the individual people. 

Even the image is not clear, there 

Now is the time people expose themselves, while people are able to live in the virtual world. To express what you see, what you feel is no longer private anymore. The border between the public and private vague. The private landscape view can be public landscape in indirect way.

This is the time you can escape from the real, society and your everyday tasks. You are having a time of abstract. Time is passing by. You can make mistake.

Yuichi Yokoyama is an artist who uses manga as his art form. He graduated from art university in fine art in Tokyo, but he started using manga style because this is more suitable medium for him.

What a gorgeos line and colour,,,,. 
The lines are so smoothe. It is almost like a sharp knife. It makes you feel in the world with different time of the speed. I think the air in this world is so pure and clean. 

His manga titles are 
"*Iceland*"
"*Garden*"
"*Travel*"
"*New Engineering*"
"*Outdoor*" 
The story (un-story) is carried on based on those subjects with charactors. They are doing annoymous activities all the time. They seems to be separated from anything else about this world. 

In Edo period, tourism became really poplar among normal citizens. The top two poplar destination were "Mt Fuji" and "Oise-mairi". People formed a cooporation to help financially each other and dreamt to go to the place once in their life time. The ukiyoe series were poplar because the desire of people towards sightseeing places. 

Impressionism artist uses thie leisure time as a subject. personally, I like Edward Manet. All his works, I don't get what people are doing. Or what kind of time they were on. Party? Drinking? Having social time? But the girl at the bar, she seem not working, she is not looking at you as well. She seems to be thinking something else. How about the couple on the boat. They are not chatting, they are sitting on the boat, even they are not rowing. 
The girl is looking at the train, and her mother is looking at somewhere else. This is the time I like. 
In opposite to Pierre-Auguste Renoir. The two girls playing piano, i can see clearly what they are doing. And the girl with piano looking at the score and other is helping her. They are not free from each other.

I used found photo from a canal magazine left in a commune laundry and painting of 'Freddie's First Visit' by James Walker. (I was interested in his another painting 'Hiking')
I exaggerated their outline and isolated and transferred the line onto paper. 

Before the interim show, I was exploring distorted figurative painting.
